## 🎯 Problem Statement

India faces a **critical edible oil crisis** - despite being an agricultural powerhouse, we import **55-60% of our edible oil needs**, costing over **₹1 lakh crore annually** in foreign exchange.

### 📊 The Challenge

| Issue | Current State | Target (2030-31) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Production** | 42.61 MT | 69 MT (NMEO-OP Goal) |
| **Import Dependency** | 55-60% | Reduce to 30% |
| **Annual Import Bill** | ₹1+ lakh crore | Save ₹50,000+ crore |
| **Value Chain Efficiency** | Fragmented | Integrated & Digital |

### 🔗 Root Causes

- **Fragmented Value Chain:** Poor coordination between farmers, processors, and retailers
- **Information Gap:** Farmers lack access to market prices and demand forecasts
- **Post-Harvest Losses:** 15-20% losses due to poor logistics and storage

### 🧪 Testing Blockchain Implementation

To ensure the blockchain integration is functioning as expected, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the required API keys for Pinata IPFS in your `.env` file.
   - Example:
     ```env
     PINATA_API_KEY=your_api_key
     PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
     ```

2. **Run the App:**
   - Start the app using the following command:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

3. **Access Blockchain Features:**
   - Navigate to the **Decentralised Records Dashboard** in the admin panel.
   - Upload a sample record to test the blockchain storage.

4. **Verify Record on IPFS:**
   - After uploading, the app will generate an IPFS hash.
   - Use the hash to verify the record on the [IPFS Gateway](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/).

5. **Test QR Code Verification:**
   - Generate a QR code for the uploaded record.
   - Scan the QR code using the app to ensure it retrieves the correct blockchain data.

6. **Check Logs:**
   - Monitor the app logs for any errors or confirmation messages related to blockchain operations.
   - Example log messages:
     - `Record successfully uploaded to IPFS.`
     - `QR code generated for record.`

7. **Run Unit Tests:**
   - Execute the blockchain-related unit tests to validate the implementation:
     ```bash
     flutter test --name blockchain
     ```

8. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter issues, ensure the API keys are correct and the Pinata service is accessible.
   - Check the network connection and retry the operation.

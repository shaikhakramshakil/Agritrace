## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Background

Despite significant growth in oilseed production, **India remains heavily dependent on imports** for **55-60% of its edible oil needs**, draining foreign exchange and exposing farmers to global market volatility.

**Key Challenges:**

- 📊 **Production Gap:** While production increased from 27.51 million tonnes (2014-15) to 42.61 million tonnes (2024-25), domestic demand of 27.8 million tonnes still requires imports worth **over ₹1 lakh crore**
- 🎯 **Ambitious Target:** Government's National Mission on Edible Oils–Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) aims to **double production to 69 million tonnes by 2030-31**
- 🔗 **Value Chain Fragmentation:** Lack of seamless coordination among farmers, FPOs, processors, and retailers
- 📉 **Post-Harvest Losses:** Inefficient logistics and storage infrastructure
- 💰 **Market Volatility:** Farmers exposed to unpredictable price fluctuations

### Platform Objectives

Develop an **AI-enabled value chain platform** to:

✅ Ensure seamless coordination among all stakeholders  
✅ Optimize logistics and minimize post-harvest losses  
✅ Integrate predictive analytics for demand-supply trends

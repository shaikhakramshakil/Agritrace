## 🎯 Problem Statement

India faces a **critical edible oil crisis** - despite being an agricultural powerhouse, we import **55-60% of our edible oil needs**, costing over **₹1 lakh crore annually** in foreign exchange.

### 📊 The Challenge

| Issue | Current State | Target (2030-31) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Production** | 42.61 MT | 69 MT (NMEO-OP Goal) |
| **Import Dependency** | 55-60% | Reduce to 30% |
| **Annual Import Bill** | ₹1+ lakh crore | Save ₹50,000+ crore |
| **Value Chain Efficiency** | Fragmented | Integrated & Digital |

### 🔗 Root Causes

- **Fragmented Value Chain:** Poor coordination between farmers, processors, and retailers
- **Information Gap:** Farmers lack access to market prices and demand forecasts
